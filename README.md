Allele Specific Expression in active TB in HIV positive Pedeatric Individuals in Eswatini, Botswana and Uganda

This is a project that was conducted by Mthande Sibonakaliso Mzwakhile from a southern country in Eswatini.

It was about variant discovery in cases and controls between three sub-Saharan countries.

It basically involves four steps:

1.Data Preprocessing
2. Variant Calling 
3. Varant annotation
4. Allele Specific Expression

It is still going to be taken further from this.
